# Fine_mapping
This repository contains scripts used for fine-mapping candidate causal genes and variants at GWAS loci using credible set analyses and eQTL-based prioritization methods, including Summary-based Mendelian Randomization (SMR) and colocalization (coloc). 

Recently used to assign candidate effector genes in the CHARGE 1000G multi-ancestry meta-analysis of coronary artery calcification (CAC), a collaboration with Maryam Kavousi, Maxime Bos, Raj Malhotra, Sander van der Laan and Clint L. Miller.
